"""Heterogeneous dual-robot MuJoCo + Fast-LIO2 + FAR nav benchmark launch.

robot_a = Go2W (wheeled-legged), robot_b = Go2 (legs only, passive feet).
Both share one MuJoCo process and one combined URDF; each runs its own
Fast-LIO2 / octomap / FAR / nav stack. A shared CFPA2 coordinator
partitions frontier goals across the two.

Scene: `demo3_mixed.xml` (Go2W at (4, 2) and Go2 at (4, -6), 24×16m).

Key deltas from `nav_test_mujoco_fastlio_dual.launch.py`:
  - MJCF: demo3_mixed.xml  (robot_b Go2W body swapped for Go2 passive-foot body)
  - ros_control: ros_control_mixed_mujoco_nav.yaml (robot_b has no wheel controller)
  - URDF: Go2W xacro for A + Go2 xacro b-prefixed for B, merged via
    `build_mixed_mujoco_urdf`
  - Controllers: robot_b gets no `robot_b_wheel_velocity_controller`
    (``wheel_controller_name=None``)
  - Cmd routing: robot_b skips `go2w_hybrid_cmd_router`; cmd_vel pipes
    directly to CHAMP's `cmd_vel_legged`.
